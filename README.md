#README.md
##This is a submission for an assignment of getting and cleaning data course project.
##This project is for getting and transforming multipe files of data for measurements of features from test ##and training datasets of measurements of features for 30 subjects and 6 activities in separate files.
##The goal of the project is to create a single output file with average of selected features by subjects and ##activities.
##In this project, run_analysis.R script file is created. This script is for extracting, transforming and ##creting an output file with average of measurement of features for each subject and activity.
The script is for completing following tasks:
1. Creating folder and downloading source data files from a given web URL.
2. Reading data from files and create variables
3. Merging and transforming multiple data sets by rows or by columns to combine dataset into one data frame variable.
4. Creating subsets with columns of feature mesurements on means and standard deviation only.
5. Giving data labels replacing portions of labels with more readable charactors.
6. For activity column, replacing numbers with description charactors.
7. Creating a new data frame with means of measurements to selected features
8. Creating an output file named *ordered_tidydata.csv*
